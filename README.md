Introduction: 
 In today's reality, this process faces several challenges, such as manual data 
entry, inefficient communication, and the risk of data corruption.
 To overcome these issues, there is a pressing need for a modernized system 
that streamlines the process of collecting and acknowledging state opinions.



Problem:
 Develop a secure and efficient system for timely communication of Legal 
Department's opinions on filing Criminal Appeals in Gujarat High Court, 
Supreme Court, and District Government Pleaders' decisions, ensuring 
admin-exclusive access for user management and swift court decision 
notifications.
 There are solutions to manage the data of the criminal appeals, but it was 
separated within High-court, Supreme-court and District-court individually


Proposed System:
 The proposed system will give the access to the High-court, Supreme-court 
and District-court to the information about the criminals and their appeals in 
court.
 The data for criminal appeals is sourced from the respective courts and is 
accessible to the specific court where a case is currently in progress, 
enabling them to access information pertaining to a particular criminal case.
 This system is a single solution to manage the data of the criminal appeals, 
the work will be easier than the old paper work and lengthy system.
 The Government can give circular or notice etc. to the institutions very 
reliably. Institutions can give the feedback for the improvement of the system.

Literature Review/Existing Innovation-technology to address related to problem
Review: 
 As we research E-Court Android Application and E-Court Website, systems 
etc.
 We found one of the E-Court Website. In this we found many bugs in it that 
can be solved and this are been not really good for the user experience.
 In this we are getting the required information about the criminal and their 
appeals, but given information are individual between High-court, Supremecourt and District-court

Approach:
 We are trying to solve the problems of the government to solve the problem 
of having the data of the criminal and information about their appeals in one 
system.
 This system will give you the access to the High-court, Supreme-court and 
District-court to have the data of the criminals and information about their 
appeals.
 This system has a platform where the court will have to give the data of the 
criminals and information about their appeals.
 High-court, Supreme-court and District-court has an access to see the data 
of any criminals and information about their appeals.
 The government can announce and give the required information , circulars or 
notice etc. to the institutions and the system has also and area were 
institutions can give the suggestions about the drawbacks and loopholes of 
the system or any education loophole or any required suggestions for the 
education system.

Technologies:
 HTML
 CSS
 JQUERY
 JAVASCRIPT
 JSON
 React JAVASCRIPT
 MYSQL
 ASP.NET Core

Challenges:
 The main challenge is to contact the legal person for the important details.


Possible Outcomes:
 Our project for the hackathon aims to create a web-based software that 
effectively addresses the critical need for streamlined data management 
across various courts.
 Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as React in the frontend and .NET 
in the backend, our solution will provide an intuitive and user-friendly 
interface, making it effortless for users to access detailed information on 
criminal cases. By integrating features to filter data by date, court name, 
advocate name, case number, and criminal name, we empower users to 
retrieve the specific details they require swiftly and efficiently.
 This innovative system will not only facilitate easy data access but also 
enable the monitoring of criminal cases at different levels, benefiting 
concerned Government officers and Government pleaders alike.
 Furthermore, our solution will offer the flexibility to fetch data based on 
various parameters like District, Case Details, Advocate, and Count, 
enhancing the accessibility of critical information for informed decisionmaking.
 Ultimately, this software will play a pivotal role in budget preparation for 
expenses related to appeals for the cause of justice, ensuring transparency 
and efficiency in the legal system.
 The expected outcome of our project is the seamless and effective 
management of criminal case data, benefiting all stakeholders involved.
